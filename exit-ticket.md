## Concatenation in Python

- Please answer the following questions 
- Use correct spelling and grammar

#### List two (2) disadvantages or problems with using concatenation to build Python strings.
I would say that one issue that concatenation has is that if there is a number/numeric value a variable is set equal too. It is slightly harder because you have to add the str funciton. 

Another issue is that it is less modern, and less people would use it over the years. Which may cause issues when it comes to viewing someones code. 


#### What's one advantage of using an f-string to build a string in Python?  (HINT: Think numeric data!)
one advantage of using an f-string to build a string in python is when a variable is a numeric value you can just put it in there. Compared to concatenation where you have to add the str function.
